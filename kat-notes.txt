I manipulate focus position and verb type: Early, late x know/believe, remember/think.

Among the experimental items, odd item numbers are late focus, even, early.
not the perfect LF tokens:
3-e-do 

Cezeryeci (7-e-do) in LF condition has a break after subject, not in EF.
Cezayirli (18-e-ikb) also has a weird intonation.
Anamurlular (23/24) not the most salient contrast.

Shota says not to complicate design. I will listen to and double check the stimuli I used for the 611 paper.

I have to figure out how many levels in verb type condition, so {bil/san, bil/dusun, hatirla/san, hatirla/dusun}, or only two, or all six. And I have to figure out whether we have that many lists, or we have only few lists with items being paired with a particular continuation. So items 1 and 2 would be bil/san, 3 and 4 would be bil/dusun, 5/6 hatirla/san, etc. (We need them to `come in pairs' so to speak so that everyone sees one bil/san in early and one bil/san in late focus conditions.)
